Time is money. It's much more than that. Money if not invested shrinks over a period of time. Time vanishes.

Like money, time is another resource which is limited and cannot be accumulated. Investment typically converts a resource into another form, which can be preserved, accumulated and grown – look at how money is invested. In the same way time can be invested by converting it into something that can be preserved.

To me investing time is to best utilize time to build up knowledge, skills, relationships etc. Now the economy is down. There is little money to invest, and there is a lot of uncertainty too. But strangely when the economy is down I see people having a lot of time – without many projects at work and not engaging in many activities outside. This time can be invested into something that builds up, that can be grown later, which can be converted into money. And yes! Time is money (and much more than that).
