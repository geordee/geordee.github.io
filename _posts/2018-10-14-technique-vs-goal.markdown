Recently I started taking swimming lessons. It was about learning something new, and achieving something extraordinary.

The first week in the pool, the struggle was to float in the water. Later it was all about swimming across the pool on the shallow end. The goal was to reach the other end of the pool. I did not know how to breathe while swimming and so it was a great task. I failed often. Because, I was so focussed on the goal, that I almost forgot the means to achieve it.

"Technique is important". The coach shouts. I have stopped midway to catch some breath. And it dawns on me. It's pointless to reach the other side, achieve the short term goal. It's the technique and skill that matters. The short term goal is to build the technique. The long term goal is to master swimming. The other side is just a milestone.

Water is always bluer on the other side!
