I have got a new weather app. It is so well-designed that I do not mind checking it daily. One of the features I like is the hourly track of temperature for 36 hours. After getting used to it for a while, I started noticing the daily patterns in temperature.

One of the interesting observations is that the coldest hour comes around 4:00 and 5:00 in the morning. Just before the sun rises. When the night has lost all it's hope about the day. And then the sun slowly rises, and the cold disappears. The dew slowly melts away and everything is fresh and new.

These days when I get into hopeless situations, I am reminded of the dark and coldest hour. And about the sun, slowly rising in the horizon, about a bright new day, a few hours away.
