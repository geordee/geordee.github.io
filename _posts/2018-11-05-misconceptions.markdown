One day, I asked my friend to take a video of my swimming. Later we analyzed it over a coffee. We found that my right hand was quick to return and not "flying" over the water. So, next day, I fixed it. Consciously, I made my right hand do what my left hand did, except it was wrong. When the swimming coach arrived, he was wondering how I lost the technique so fast.

I was acting based on my misconceptions. It was a self-diagnosis. I was uninformed. It was damaging. Oftentimes, our actions are based on our misconceptions. Well-intentioned, potentially damaging.

Yet, it is not recommended not to take actions fearing potential issues. It is better to act, learn and correct as often as possible.
