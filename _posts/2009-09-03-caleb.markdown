> It's hard for us to conceive,  
> Why on earth you had to leave.  
> But if we listen, we'll hear God say,  
> "Here is where he at peace shall lay".  
> You're already in beautiful heaven above,  
> And can see nothing but God's love.  
> Even though we may not understand,  
> We can be sure Jesus is holding your hand.  
> You were the most beautiful baby, and though we despair  
> We know God will look after you with tender loving care.  
> You are safe in His hands now.  
> Sweet dreams, Little One.
