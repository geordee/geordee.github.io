How long does it take to fuel your car? It usually takes 4-5 minutes to fill the gas, and depending on how busy the gas station is, there would be some wait time too. Is it possible to bring digital experiences during the time spent at a gas station? That depends on what digital really means.

I often refer to the [2015 McKinsey article by Karel Dörner and David Edelman](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/what-digital-really-means) to describe the characteristics and capabilities of a digital product or solution. The authors list four core capabilities to describe a digital business - Journey-focused Innovation, Contextual Interactivity, Proactive Decision Making, and Real-time Automation. I am fascinated by how these four capabilities comprehensively cover almost all aspects of digital products, ranging from user experience, mobile devices, data, intelligence, integration and APIs.

To quote from the original article:

> “Digital is about implementing a cyclical dynamic where processes and capabilities are constantly evolving based on inputs from the customer, fostering ongoing product or service loyalty. Making this happen requires an interconnected set of four core capabilities.”

It is important to realize that the four capabilities do not operate independently or sequentially. For example, personalization of service requires insights from an analytics layer and real-time integrations across different systems, departments or functions.

Let us drive to the gas station. First let us open the app and check nearby gas stations and the wait times. Well there is a station 8 minutes away, and the current wait time is approximately 5 minutes. The app also gives an estimated wait time of 4 minutes by the time we get there. It is doing some real-time, in-stream analytics and near-term predictions in the background!

Earlier, there was a reminder notification to check the fuel level and offered a refill at home. But we will top it up on our way. If it was a bigger station, we could have reserved a slot. Here we have to wait.

As we drive into the station, an Automated Number Plate Recognition camera recognizes the license plate. In the background, the system matches the plate number to my loyalty and privilege program. The system knows when, where and how I usually fill up the car, and when I filled up last time. It knows whether one waits for the tank to be empty or keeps topping up at half-tank. It knows that I will spend around 4 minutes at the station. It knows my preferred fuel and the add-ons I often purchase. Through a data marketplace, it also knows when I changed my tires last, and the time since last service. Of course, I had to give my consent to pull my data from the marketplace.

There is a friendly greeting through in-app notification. There are some recent in-store promotions, and a free tire check-up. There is a lightning deal on quick car wash too. I wonder whether the camera recognized the dusty windshield! There is an empty bay for automatic car wash and I have some time to quickly drive through. I guess the system had correlated events and matched an empty car wash bay with a known customer driving a dusty car!

The time I spent in the gas station was productive. The app helped me glance through the vehicle condition and get some good deals. The gas station was able to keep the customer happy, and sell an empty slot in the automatic car wash.

The gas station is also evolving. Today, electric cars can be charged anywhere - at home, in malls or at EV stations. There is a bay for 10-12 electric vehicles, and a digital mall next to it. You could browse through merchandise using a high resolution curved 3D LED screen and that experience is amazing. And there is a fairly large locker room for collecting the deliveries too.

The gas station has created seamless and fluid customer experiences, overlaying a physical world of goods and services, or just over a physical space in some cases. The fact that there are 100s of gas stations in the city, with similar experiences assure accessibility and quality of services.

Under the hood, there are systems implementing customer journeys, contextual interactions, proactive decision-making, and real-time automations. And when those systems cooperate, collaborate and become invisible to us, true digital experiences are created.
