I was preparing some notes on "stewardship of time" and came across this poem.

> Just a tiny little minute,  
> Only sixty seconds in it,  
> Forced upon me, can't refuse it,  
> Didn't seek it, didn't choose it,  
> But it's up to me to use it,  
> Give account if I abuse it.  
> Just a tiny little minute,  
> But eternity is in it.  
> _â€“ Author Unknown_  

I sat there for a moment and wondered how much meaning it conveyed to me. May be the entire message on "stewardship of time" is in it.
